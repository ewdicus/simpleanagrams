# Setup

Run `npm install` and `npm start`.

To use nodemon to restart when changes are made run `npm run-script dev`.

Some simple tests can be ran with `npm test`.

# Issues and Limitations

I've limited the maximum query size to 12 letters (arbitrarily), but even that
can take a little while or timeout on a platform like Heroku.

I've added a 1 second timeout to the Ajax request so it doesn't wait forever.

A smarter algorithm could make this less of an issue, but at some stage you're
still searching for a needle in a haystack.

Additionally I could store anagrams of words as they're generated for later
lookup, or pre-process words in a worker.
